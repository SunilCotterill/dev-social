## Acknowledgement
This social media webapp is extended from the final project of Brad Traversy's [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/learn/lecture/10055468#content). The CSS was unaltered from the original project.

## Technologies
I used React for the frontend and Redux for state management. The backend was built using Node.js and Express with a MongoDB document databse

## Features
